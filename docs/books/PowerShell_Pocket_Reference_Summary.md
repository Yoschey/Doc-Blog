## Overview

“**PowerShell Pocket Reference**” is the compact companion to Lee Holmes’ *PowerShell Cookbook*.  
While the Cookbook teaches concepts through examples, the Pocket Reference focuses on **syntax, parameters, and quick command recall**.  

It’s designed as a **concise, portable guide** that helps professionals quickly look up commands, operators, and examples without searching online or reading through long manuals.  
The 4th Edition includes updates for **PowerShell 7**, covering both Windows PowerShell and cross-platform PowerShell Core.

## Purpose of the Book

- Serve as a **quick-access syntax guide** for daily PowerShell work.  
- Provide **ready-to-use command patterns** for common tasks.  
- Bridge the gap between learning and efficient execution.  
- Help experienced users remember details like parameter names, operators, and formatting options.

## Book Structure and Key Sections

### **1. Getting Started**
- Basic PowerShell architecture and version differences (Windows PowerShell vs PowerShell Core).  
- Command syntax, pipelines, and the help system (`Get-Help`, `Get-Command`, `Get-Member`).  
- Core concepts: cmdlets, objects, and providers.  
- Shell shortcuts and command discovery techniques.

### **2. PowerShell Language Fundamentals**
- Variables, data types, and scope.  
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, redirection).  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `switch`, `?:`) and loops (`for`, `foreach`, `while`).  
- Arrays, hash tables, and custom objects.  
- String interpolation and formatting rules.

### **3. The Pipeline and Objects**
- Object-based pipeline mechanics.  
- Passing data between cmdlets effectively.  
- Using `Select-Object`, `Where-Object`, and `ForEach-Object`.  
- Sorting and grouping objects.  
- Best practices for filtering early and formatting late.

### **4. Formatting and Output**
- Formatting objects as tables, lists, or wide views (`Format-Table`, `Format-List`).  
- Redirecting output (`Out-File`, `Out-GridView`, `Export-Csv`).  
- Managing encoding and output streams.  
- Customizing console views and colors.

### **5. Error Handling and Debugging**
- Understanding terminating vs non-terminating errors.  
- Using `Try/Catch/Finally` and `$ErrorActionPreference`.  
- Working with `$?`, `$LASTEXITCODE`, and `$Error`.  
- Debugging scripts interactively and using breakpoints.  
- Logging and tracing command execution.

### **6. Working with the File System and Registry**
- File and directory commands (`Get-ChildItem`, `Copy-Item`, `Remove-Item`).  
- File content manipulation (`Get-Content`, `Set-Content`, `Add-Content`).  
- Working with symbolic links, ACLs, and permissions.  
- Registry as a provider: reading/writing registry keys like files.

### **7. Working with Processes, Services, and Events**
- Managing processes (`Get-Process`, `Stop-Process`, `Start-Process`).  
- Working with Windows services and scheduled tasks.  
- Querying and filtering system event logs (`Get-EventLog`, `Get-WinEvent`).  
- Useful one-liners for performance monitoring.

### **8. Remoting and Jobs**
- Configuring and using PowerShell Remoting (`Enable-PSRemoting`, `Invoke-Command`).  
- Using background jobs (`Start-Job`, `Receive-Job`).  
- Parallel processing patterns.  
- Remote sessions and credentials management.

### **9. Modules, Functions, and Scripts**
- Creating, loading, and managing PowerShell modules.  
- Writing functions with parameters and advanced function attributes.  
- Splatting and common parameter handling.  
- Importing modules and controlling scope visibility.  
- Script execution policies and code signing.

### **10. Data and APIs**
- Working with CSV, JSON, and XML (`ConvertTo-Json`, `ConvertFrom-Csv`).  
- Interacting with REST APIs via `Invoke-RestMethod`.  
- Handling authentication and custom headers.  
- Consuming .NET libraries directly in PowerShell.

### **11. Security and Administration**
- Credential storage (`Get-Credential`, SecureString handling).  
- Managing certificates and digital signatures.  
- Execution policies (`Get-ExecutionPolicy`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`).  
- Security logging and best practices for secure scripting.

### **12. Useful One-Liners and Quick Commands**
- File cleanup and archiving snippets.  
- System info and performance snapshots.  
- Event log queries and service restarts.  
- Network tests (`Test-Connection`, `Test-NetConnection`).  
- Date/time utilities and formatting tricks.
