## Overview

“**DevOps for Dummies**” serves as a friendly and comprehensive guide to understanding what DevOps really means — both as a **technical discipline** and a **cultural movement**.  
It explains how development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams collaborate to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality.  

The book balances **strategy and practice**: it introduces the cultural foundations of DevOps, explains modern CI/CD workflows, and walks through practical tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.  
It’s ideal for readers new to DevOps or those looking to align their teams with best practices.
